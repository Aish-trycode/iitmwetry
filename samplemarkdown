## 👨‍💻 Data Snippet

Here’s a basic representation of how the data was transformed:

```sass
$week-steps: (5000, 7200, 6800, 5500, 9000, 10000, 8400);

@mixin average-steps($steps) {
  $total: 0;
  @each $s in $steps {
    $total: $total + $s;
  }
  $average: $total / length($steps);
  @return $average;
}
